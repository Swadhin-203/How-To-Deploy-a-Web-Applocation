    "# Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "Ans:Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting websites and web applications. The main differences between the two are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure: Traditional web hosting typically involves a single server that is dedicated to hosting a website or web application. In contrast, cloud hosting uses a network of interconnected servers that work together to host websites and applications. This allows cloud hosting to offer more flexibility and scalability than traditional hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Cloud hosting is much more scalable than traditional hosting. With traditional hosting, if the traffic to a website or application increases beyond the capacity of the server, the website or application may become slow or crash. With cloud hosting, additional resources can be added automatically to handle increases in traffic, ensuring that the website or application remains fast and responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost: Traditional hosting typically involves a fixed monthly or yearly fee, regardless of how much traffic the website or application receives. With cloud hosting, users only pay for the resources they use, making it more cost-effective for smaller websites and applications that do not receive a lot of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability: Cloud hosting is generally more reliable than traditional hosting because it uses redundant servers and data centers to ensure that websites and applications remain online even if one server or data center fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control: With traditional hosting, users have full control over the server and can customize it to meet their specific needs. With cloud hosting, the server is managed by the cloud provider, and users have limited control over the underlying infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, cloud hosting offers greater flexibility, scalability, and reliability than traditional hosting, while also being more cost-effective for smaller websites and applications. However, traditional hosting may still be a good option for users who require more control over the underlying infrastructure."
